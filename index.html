<br>Hi! I am a fourth year PHD student in the department of Computer Science in Purdue University, advised by Prof. Bharat Bhargava. 

My primary research focus is in language model and its biases. I have been working on projects on custom language model and invesigated the temporal and positional bias in language model. 
Most recently, I worked on project on improving language model embedding on recommdation tasks using weakly supervised pretraining. Before PHD program, I graduated from the Dalhousie University with Master of Applied Science degree in Computer Engineering. I got my bachelor degree in Guangdong University of Technology in China. .

When I am not doing research, I like to work out, play basetball, and watch movies.<br>
