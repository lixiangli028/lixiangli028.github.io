<br>Hi! I am a fourth year PHD student in the department of Computer Science in Purdue University, advised by Professor Bharat Bhargava. 

My primary research focus is in language model and its biases. I have been working on projects on custom language model and invesigated the temporal and positional bias in language model. 
Most recently, I worked on project to improve language model embedding on recommdation tasks using weakly supervised pretraining during a research internship in Meta Inc. Before PHD program, I graduated from the Dalhousie University with Master of Applied Science degree in Computer Engineering. I got my bachelor of engineering degree in Guangdong University of Technology in China.

When I am not doing research, I like to work out, play basetball, and watch movies.<br>
