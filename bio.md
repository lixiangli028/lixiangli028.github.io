Hi! I am a fourth year PHD student in the department of Computer Science in Purdue University, advised by [Prof. Bharat Bhargava](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/bb/). My primary research interests are exploring novel ways to efficiently train and apply large language models in sample-limited and computation-limited scenarios. I am currently working on **data valuation**, hopefully derived from **model preference**, for a more efficient pre-training procedure.

Previously, I graduated from the Dalhousie University with Master of Applied Science degree in Computer Engineering. I got my bachelor degree in Guangdong University of Technology in China. .

When I am not doing research, I like to work out, play basetball, and watch movies.
