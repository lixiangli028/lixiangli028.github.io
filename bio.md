Hi! I am a fourth year PHD student in the department of Computer Science in Purdue University, advised by [Prof. Bharat Bhargava](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/bb/). My primary research focus is in language model and its biases. Previously, I graduated from the Dalhousie University with Master of Applied Science degree in Computer Engineering. I got my bachelor degree in Guangdong University of Technology in China. 

When I am not doing research, I like to work out, play basetball, and watch movies.
